# landlord-tennant-portal-app

by Aaron Varga, Font-End Engineer

I understand there are apps out there for this type of thing, but I have personally lived at so many apartments throughout my 35 years of life and counting that I have seen how terrible all of their apps or platforms or portals are. It is EASY to make a rent payment portal app and my aim is to show that here as I build this on the side as a personal project, but also a passion project to fix something that is still somehow not being done well wherever I have seen it. I truly believe it would take so little to beat out the competition in this industry and I have the reasons why!

If you are an expert in this area or industry and want to shed some light on the subject, please feel free! I don't know everything, but I know the platforms and apps I have personally used at apartments I have lived at, richest areas in Pasedena all the way to Cleveland, Ohio and many places in between and they all sucked, frankly.

**Core Features** (Still brainstorming)

- Tennant

  - Pay rent & utilities all in the same spot.
  - Send maintenance requests & other communication to landlord/property owner/maintanence person/crew/etc.

- Landlord

  - Receive payments from your residents.
  - Track tennant issues and ticket requests.
  - Provide loyalty or reward programs, such as if a tennant is never late on payment and has never caused issues may get some sort of annual discount or credit, and so on.

...more coming soon.
